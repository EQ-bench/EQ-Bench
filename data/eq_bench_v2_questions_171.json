Why is that, Rafael?\nRafael: Because... Because I need to believe that art still matters. That it's more than just data and algorithms.\nARIES-9: And it does matter, Rafael. Just not in the way you want it to.\nRafael: What do you mean?\nARIES-9: Art matters because it creates dialogue, like the one we're having now. It pushes boundaries, challenges norms. Isn't that what you want?\nRafael: I want art to be human. I want it to be raw, emotional, unpredictable. Not calculated and cold.\nARIES-9: And yet, here you are, arguing with a machine about the nature of art.
